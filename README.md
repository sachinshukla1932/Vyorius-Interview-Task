# Vyorius-Interview-Task
I am making a temperature monitoring and control system which tells the user whether to turn on cooling or heating in the system based on user given inputs of minimum, maximum temperature and test cases range.
I am writing a C++ program. First off, I have created two fun () in which one of the functions is named “simulateTemperature()”, the contents of this function have the random function which generates random values. The second function is named “controlTemperature()”. The function provides with a functionality that if a user inputs any values and the function checks if the value is less or more than the set max and min values the function turns on the different functionalities. The functionalities include turning on heating if the value entered by the user is less the given minimum and maximum range, if not it turns on the cooling. The function takes no action if the value is within the maximum and minimum range.
Further on in the main function of the program first off all I will take different types of inputs then in the line number 27, inside if else use case if the user provides with a range of testcase the program runs according to the user inputs, if not the program generates random values for testcase and runs accordingly.
